As it turns out, a musician and a programmer aren’t so different.

I’ve always had an eye for patterns and a knack for solving problems. Originally from the San Francisco bay area, I moved to Berlin last year. I’m a trained jazz guitarist but a Software Engineer friend working for MongoDB introduced me to the world of programming. It didn’t take long before I was completely hooked. Both playing music and writing code require attention to detail, tenacity, and unearthing simplicity in complexity.

I began hacking my way through Ruby on Rails but quickly realized I needed a more structured pedagogy. The Flatiron School, which has been New York City’s #1 coding bootcamp for a few years, recently launched an online course, Learn-Verified. I’ve spent half a year learning to code full-time and have recently completed their market-driven, full-stack web development course.

I’m now looking for employment in a Berlin-based company devoted to writing clean, tested code and with a welcoming environment for newcomers.

I’m comfortable with the following:

* html
* css
* mysql
* ruby 
* ruby on rails
* javascript

and I want to learn more about:

* node.js
* go
* React
* MongoDB

My skills are fresh but I have immense energy to learn more and be mentored. I can't wait to build together with other engineers!
